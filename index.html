This level of growth and market leadership relies heavily on the sales teams who translate that intensity into new revenue.</p><p>Maintaining consistent, high-quality messaging at scale is a significant challenge for large sales organizations. Often, reps spend more time writing emails than selling, which can dilute that 'execution intensity' you mentioned.</p><p>Colca Compose acts as an AI SDR writer, automating the creation of hyper-personalized outreach. It ensures every message reflects Coforge's unique value proposition, freeing your sales team to focus on closing deals rather than on copywriting\u2014directly impacting sales productivity and, ultimately, revenue growth.</p><p>We help large teams like yours engineer more meetings by turning lead insights into persuasive, human-sounding outreach automatically.</p><p>Would you be open to a brief 15-minute demo to see how we align with Coforge's growth trajectory? Alternatively, could you direct me to the appropriate person in your sales or revenue operations leadership?</p><p><a href='https://calendly.com/your-sales-rep/15min' style='background-color:#007bff; color:white; padding:10px 15px; text-decoration:none; border-radius:5px; display:inline-block; margin-bottom:12px;'>Book a 15-Minute Demo</a></p><p>Best regards,</p><p>Sam</p></body></html>

<div style='padding:0; margin:0;'><p>Hi Saurabh,</p><p>Following up on my last note. I noticed you shared Coforge's strong Q1 and Q2 performance this year, highlighting consistent execution and momentum. For sales teams, this pressure to maintain momentum means every minute counts.</p><p>Yet, reps often get bogged down in manual research and writing, which takes them away from revenue-generating activities. This friction slows down outreach, risking that hard-won momentum when pipelines aren't filled fast enough.</p><p>Colca Compose automates this entire process. Our AI doesn't just write emails; it learns your brand tone and product positioning, ensuring every message feels handcrafted by your best rep, consistently. This frees your team to focus on conversations, not copywriting, directly fueling that growth momentum.</p><p>Could you direct me to the right person in your sales or revenue leadership to explore this?</p><p><a href='https://calendly.com/your-sales-rep/15min' style='background-color:#007bff; color:white; padding:10px 15px; text-decoration:none; border-radius:5px; display:inline-block; margin-bottom:12px;'>Book a 15-Minute Demo</a></p><p>Best regards,</p><p>Sam</p></div>

<div style='padding:0; margin:0;'><p>Hi Saurabh,</p><p>Sales teams often struggle to adapt their messaging as fast as the market moves. When a new hire starts or a new signal appears, reps are already behind.</p><p>This delay means missed opportunities. Your team might be sending outreach based on last week's data, making your messaging feel generic and irrelevant, which kills engagement.</p><p>Colca Compose connects directly to live web data and intent signals. Our Adaptive Learning Loop refines email tone and sequences based on real-time campaign results, improving performance with every send. This ensures your outreach is always timely and effective.</p><p><a href='https://calendly.com/your-sales-rep/15min' style='background-color:#007bff; color:white; padding:10px 15px; text-decoration:none; border-radius:5px; display:inline-block; margin-bottom:12px;'>Book a 15-Minute Demo</a></p><p>Best regards,</p><p>Sam</p></div>

<div style='padding:0; margin:0;'><p>Hi Aman,</p><p>Following up on my last note.
