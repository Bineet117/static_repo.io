<p>Hi Shradha,</p><p>Your recent post about the Bihar results and the importance of ground-level connection over digital noise really resonated. Your line, \"In India, politics is shaped not by the loudness of digital narratives but by the quiet credibility earned through presence,\" strikes a chord well beyond politics\u2014it's a core challenge in business outreach, too.</p><p>In a world of automated, impersonal messages, building that genuine connection at scale feels almost impossible. How do you ensure every outreach effort YourStory makes carries the same authentic, ground-level credibility you wrote about, without having your team spend hours on manual personalization?</p><p>We built Colca Compose to solve this. It's an AI that helps teams write hyper-personalized emails by understanding a prospect's unique context\u2014like a new product launch or hiring trend\u2014and crafting a message that sounds human and relevant. It\u2019s about turning digital outreach into a meaningful, one-to-one connection, embodying that \"quiet credibility\" at scale.</p><p>Imagine your partnership or sales teams communicating with the nuance of your best storyteller, consistently.</p><p>Would you be open to a brief 15-minute chat to see how we're helping companies build trust, not noise, in their outreach?</p><p><a href='https://calendly.com/your-sales-rep/15min' style='background-color:#007bff; color:white; padding:10px 15px; text-decoration:none; border-radius:5px; display:inline-block; margin-bottom:12px;'>Book a 15-Minute Demo</a></p><p>Best regards,</p><p>Sam</p>

<div style='padding:0; margin:0;'><p>Hi Shradha,</p><p>Following up on my previous email.</p><p>Every great story, like the ones you featured about the young founders from Kashmir at TechSparks, needs to reach the right audience with a personal touch. But scaling that personalized outreach for partnerships or events is a massive resource drain, forcing teams to choose between quality and quantity.</p><p>This often leads to generic, ineffective communication that fails to capture the unique narrative of each potential partner. Your team's valuable time is spent on repetitive writing instead of building the relationships that matter.</p><p>Colca Compose acts as an AI writer that learns your brand's unique voice. It enables your team to craft hundreds of highly personalized outreach emails that resonate like a handcrafted message, ensuring every story you tell lands with impact. This frees them up to focus on strategy, not just syntax.</p><p><a href='https://calendly.com/your-sales-rep/15min' style='background-color:#007bff; color:white; padding:10px 15px; text-decoration:none; border-radius:5px; display:inline-block; margin-bottom:12px;'>Book a 15-Minute Demo</a></p><p>Best regards,</p><p>Sam</p></div>

<br>
<div style='padding:0; margin:0;'><p>Shradha,</p><p>Keeping your team's outreach consistent and on-brand is tough, especially as you scale. Without a unified system, messaging can become fragmented, losing the powerful, unified voice you've built at YourStory, a voice that champions India's entrepreneurs.</p><p>This inconsistency dilutes your brand's impact with every send. Colca Compose's Adaptive Learning Loop solves this by analyzing campaign results, continuously refining the tone and messaging to match what works best. It ensures every email feels like it came from your top strategist, getting smarter with every reply.</p><p>Could 15 minutes this week be valuable to see how?</p><p><a href='https://calendly.com/your-sales-rep/15min' style='background-color:#007bff; color:white; padding:10px 15px; text-decoration:none; border-radius:5px; display:inline-block; margin-bottom:12px;'>Book a 15-Minute Demo</a></p><p>Best regards,</p><p>Sam</p></div>

<p>Saurabh, congrats on stepping into the CFO role at Coforge.

At Colca.ai, we help large sales organizations maintain that execution intensity without ballooning headcount.

<div style='padding:0; margin:0;'><p>Re: Saurabh, a financial angle on Coforge\u2019s growth intensity</p><p>Saurabh, even with strong Q2 FY26 performance, scaling revenue often means expensive increases in sales headcount. The cost of acquiring new customers creeps up as teams expand, yet productivity per rep frequently plateaus.</p><p>This drags down margins and slows the momentum you've built. Compose by Colca.ai offers a different path: operational leverage.
